            <h2> Impact on Victims</h2>
        <p>
          The victims undergo severe psychological trauma with a lot of fear, shame, humiliation, anxiety, depression, self-blaming, and hopelessness. These feelings may result in self-harm, suicidal feelings and tragic consequences may be suicide.

The most common feelings and experiences reported are panic, embarrassment, desperation, and no way out.
Studies indicate that the victims always report having been fearful, angry, humiliated, shameful, and self-blaming, which are sometimes manifested in the physical or self-harming behaviors.
To youths (teens, in particular 13 20), 1/7 of victims self-harm because of it, and the rates are approximately three times higher when it comes to LGBTQ+ youth because of the additional isolation.
Male victims experience suicidal thoughts often, which are intensified with other related feelings such as guilt and embarrassment.
Sextortion has been the cause of many suicides tragically: at least 20-36 teenage boys since 2021 in the US alone, and the number is rapidly increasing (in some cases within hours).


            
        </p>
        <h3> Impact on Familes </h3>
        <p> 
        Sextortion destroys families both on the emotional and relation levels.

Relatives and siblings can easily struggle with grief, shock, and guilt particularly in cases of suicide whereby there were few warning signs as the crime occurred quickly.
There are losses of relationships, reported by families almost half of the victims lose contacts with friends, family, or partners as a result of the victimization.
Stories of survivors emphasize the fact that the crime in question is devastating children and devastating families entirely, parents of such children as Ryan Last or Gavin Guffey went public to create awareness of the issue after their sons have committed suicide.
Continuous extortion impairs the family dynamics, since the victims conceal the situation in shame, and postponing the support.
        
        
        
        </p>

        <h3> Impact on Society </h3>
        <p>
        Sextortion is an increasing social and financial liability.

The number of reports has gone through the ceiling: NCMEC has been getting an average of around 812 sextortion reports a week over the past few years, and financial cases have been prevalent, with almost 100 cases a day in 2024.
In 2024 the FBI recorded a total of about 55000 sextortion related crimes with a loss of money to the tune of 33.5 million (the highest amount in years).
It undermines the belief in online platforms, disproportionately impacts youth (e.g., boys in financial, girls in relational cases), and brings vulnerabilities into online space, which are often organized by international networks (e.g., West Africa or Southeast Asia).

            <h2>About </h2>

            <p> Sextortion is a form of extortion. Extortion is defined as the use of coercion to obtain money, goods, or services from an individual.​ 
        Which also counts as blackmail. More specifically sextortion is extortion of sexual images/content  or extorsion using sexual images/content </p>
         <p>  Sextortion is a serious crime that occurs when someone threatens to distribute your private and sensitive material if you don’t provide them images of a sexual nature, 
         sexual favors, or money.The perpetrator may also threaten to harm your friends or relatives by using information they have obtained from your electronic devices unless you 
        comply with their demands. </p>

            <h2> Learning on what to look out for </h2>
         <p>     The Sextortionist will often chose targets they think they can decieve. Primarily utilizing social media platforms like Instagram, snapchat and twitter now X. 
             In the image below you can see that instagram gave a warning before I followed this person back showing me a breif history of the account. In some cases the 
             Predators are well established like this one being made since 2016. In other cases sometimes case the accounts bacn be newer.

         <p>     These predators will try to become your friend and get you comfortable and engage you in converastion to break down your defenses. 
            A rule of thumb to abide by is if you do not know them or have any mutual friends do not add them and do not accept any conversation request. In the image below you can see that I engaged 
            in coversation with the Individual. </p>

        <h3>Most Common Group</h3>
        <p>Teenage Boys 
      Currently the number-one targeted group in financial sextortion cases.
      Offenders (often overseas criminal networks) pretend to be a girl their age and pressure them into sending explicit images.
      Boys are more likely to panic, hide the situation, and pay quickly—making them high-reward targets.
            (National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, 2024; Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2024).</p>
     <p> Young Men (18–25)
        Especially on dating apps, Instagram, Snapchat, and Discord.
       More likely to engage with strangers online and send photos impulsively.
       Attackers use both romantic lures and fake “underage girl” threats.
     </p>
    <p>Teen Girls & Young Women
    Still targeted, especially in sextortion for control, relationship coercion, or harassment.
    Often involves ex-partners, classmates, or people they know.
    Cases include threats to release images, stalking, and emotional manipulation.  
    </p> 
     <p>Adults in High-Stress or High-Trust Roles
     Teachers, military members, medical staff, and professionals.
     Offenders assume these individuals will pay to hide the situation due to reputation or career risks.

            <h2>How to help</h2>
            <h3>Immediate Steps for the Victim</h3>
           <p>Stop all communication with the extortionist Do NOT pay anything. Paying almost always leads to more demands.
Block them on every platform, but do not delete the chat/profile yet (evidence). </p>
           <h3>Preserve all evidence</h3>
            <p> Take screenshots of: 
                The threats
                Their username/profile links (OnlyFans, Snapchat, Instagram, Telegram, etc.)
                Any photos/videos they claim to have
                Payment demands (Bitcoin wallet, CashApp, etc.)
               Do NOT delete the accounts or conversations yet. 
            </p>
            <h3>Deactivate (don’t delete) social media temporarily</h3>
            <p>Facebook/Instagram: Settings “Take a break” or temporarily deactivate.
          Snapchat/TikTok: Same option exists.
          This prevents the extortionist from easily finding friends/family.
            </p>
            <h3> </h3>
            <p>Report the account everywhere it appeared
            Platform reporting (Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter/X, Facebook, Discord, etc.)
